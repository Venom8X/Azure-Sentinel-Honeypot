### Threat Visualization in Microsoft Sentinel

1. **Run the Query**:
   - Click **Run Query** to process your data.

2. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If any custom fields (**CF**) cause issues, remove the problematic field from the query and re-run the search.

3. **Set Visualization**:
   - From the **Visualization** dropdown menu, select **Map**.

4. **Configure Map Settings**:
   - Open **Map Settings** > **Layout Settings** (on the right side of the screen).
   - Under **Location Info Using**, select **longitude/latitude** (if these cause issues, try **country** or **region** as an alternative).
   - Set:
     - **Latitude**: `latitude_CF`
     - **Longitude**: `longitude_CF`

5. **Configure Metric Settings**:
   - Scroll down to **Metric Settings**.
   - Set:
     - **Metric Label**: `label_CF`
     - **Metric Value**: `event_count`

6. **Apply Settings**:
   - Click **Apply** to save the configuration.

7. **Visualize Attack Locations**:
   - Observe the map to see where your VM is being attacked from.
   - Initially, you might only see failed login attempts you made, but after some time, refresh the map to view additional attack data.

8. **Analyze Logs**:
   - Inspect the logs for details like source IP, time, country, username, and other relevant information.

**Note** 
- These logs only report failed RDP attempts. Consider exploring other logs to uncover additional potential attack types.
